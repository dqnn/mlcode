- underfitting will fail on training data and prediction while over fitting not
- overfitting will fail on prediction not on training
- for example use linear to predicte curve preidiction 
- mode details about underfitting as following:
-  Model is too simple
- Very high regularization
- Features are weak or missing
- Not enough training
- High bias


- overfiting
Bias–Variance Inside Overfitting
Overfitting is mainly caused by high variance:

High variance means model reacts too strongly to training data
Learns noise as patterns
Low bias because the model is extremely flexible
